## Setup Instructions

   php -S localhost:8000 -t public
   ```

2. **Start the React Frontend:**
   ```bash
   cd fitness-website
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Test the API:**
   ```bash
   cd fitness-api-php
   php test_api.php
   ```

## Authentication

The system requires admin authentication. Make sure to:
1. Login as an admin user
2. Store the authentication token in localStorage as "adminAuth"
3. Include the token in API requests as Bearer token

## Database Requirements

Ensure the following tables exist:
- `categorys` (note: table name is intentionally "categorys")
- `products`
- `admins`

## File Structure

```
fitness-app/
├── fitness-api-php/
│   ├── app/
│   │   ├── controllers/
│   │   │   ├── AdminCategoriesController.php
│   │   │   └── AdminProductsController.php
│   │   └── models/
│   │       ├── Category.php
│   │       └── Product.php
│   ├── public/
│   │   └── uploads/ (for product images)
│   └── test_api.php
└── fitness-website/
    └── app/
        └── admin/
            └── products/
                └── page.tsx
```

## Testing

Use the provided `test_api.php` script to verify that:
1. The server is running
2. API endpoints are accessible
3. Authentication is properly enforced

## Notes

- The category table is named "categorys" (not "categories") - this is intentional
- Image uploads are stored in the `public/uploads/` directory
- All API responses follow a consistent format with status, message, and data fields
- The frontend uses toast notifications for user feedback
- Pagination is implemented for better performance with large datasets
